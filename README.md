# Fractionals
The Fractions module presents experimental constructed Num Types (Fractions and Proper Fractions).
Since Haskell is a ML language, it gives one strong control over how arithmetic computations 
may be represented within the computer itself. This module uses that power to explore 
the powerful and simple propeties of rational numbers using tupled ints.
